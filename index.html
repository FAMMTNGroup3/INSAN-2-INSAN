                NGOs are a subgroup of organizations founded by citizens, which include clubs and associations
                that provide services to their members and others. NGOs are usually nonprofit organizations,
                and many of them are active in humanitarianism or the social sciences. Surveys indicate that
                NGOs have a high degree of public trust,
                which can make them a useful proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.
